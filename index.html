        <h3>
            The mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz) is a small primate in the family Lemuridae, 
            native to Madagascar and introduced to the Comoros Islands. These arboreal animals 
            have pointed faces, long, bushy tails, dark-brown upper parts, pale bellies, 
            and beards, which are reddish in males and white in females. They live in family 
            groups and feed primarily on fruit, but also eat leaves, flowers, and nectar, with 
            nectar from the kapok tree making up a large part of their diet during the dry season.
             They have declined sharply in numbers because of habitat destruction and hunting, and 
             the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated their conservation status 
             as "critically endangered".
